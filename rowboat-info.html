			<h1>Rowboat Simulator</h1>
			<p><em>Software for Oslo Fjord Museum.</em></p>
			<p>This was one of the most rewarding projects I've done.</p>
			<p>I did this with my talented childhood friend and movie director <a href="http://www.axp.no/">Anders &Oslash;vergaard</a>. To finish the project before launch we had to sleep over at the museum. I also had to co-operate with another friend of mine who is a hardware engineer.</p> 
			<p>Fun story: politicians and press were having their welcome drinks at the pre-opening of the museum, while I was still trying to fix the last known bug. I thought I fixed it after a restart, and the event was successful. Later I figured out it was a memory leak causing the occasional crashes. This is the grand attraction at the museum, so it was important that it worked properly. After a couple of months I heard that our attraction was the only one that didn't have bugs or other short-coming (they hired other firms to do other attractions), and that they were very pleased with our work.</p>
