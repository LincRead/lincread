				<h4>Short story</h4>
				<p>I'm a Norwegian Game Developer. I currently live in Australia with my partner and our daughter. I love my craft and if you hire me for work I will make you very happy.</p>
				<h4>Long story</h4>
				<p>I'm a Norwegian Game Developer who's been obsesses with computer games since I was 6 years old. When I was 13 my neighbor who was 12 and I discussed how to afford more video games to play. <em>What if we make a web site where we review games, maybe companies will send us free promo games?</em> That's what happened. Our post boxes filled up with new games from Sony, Microsoft, EA, Ubisoft etc. We had to find additional writers to get through them all.</p>
				<p>
				After a couple of years writing for a few gaming and eSport sites, and graduating from advance classes, I decided to see if game development could be something for me, so I started my higher education in Experience Production and Interactive Medias at Hamar College University. I initially wanted to be a game designer and make art, but quickly found myself learning to program so I could actually make something to play.</p>
				<p>
				I contemplated joining a start up with fellow students after graduating, but I didn't feel like I had the theory tool box to call myself a decent programmer, so I took two additional years of Computer Science at University of Oslo. During those years I eventually joined a start-up. From there on my life was filled with start-ups, game jams, freelance work, taking lecturing jobs, for a couple of years, trying to gain as much experience as possible
				</p>
				<p>
				Then I grew out of that phase, fell in love with my Australian partner (we now have a daughter together), and moved to Australia. These days I'm still taking remote freelance work for Norwegian companies. I'm also doing all kinds of non-geeky stuff like playing soccer, climbing a hill with the pram, and exploring how it is to live like an aussie.
				</p>
				<p>
				At the moment I'm looking for new career opportunities, so please let me know if you have a suggestion.
